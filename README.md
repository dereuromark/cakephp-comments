Comments plugin for CakePHP applications.

NOte: THIS IS A **WIP** PLUGIN - Please help to finish it up.

This branch is for use with **CakePHP 5.0+**. For details see [version map](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-comments/wiki#cakephp-version-map).

## Features

The old Comments plugins dont seem to be supported anymore:
- https://github.com/CakeDC/comments (Cake 2)
- https://github.com/QoboLtd/cakephp-comments (Cake 3)

This plugin aims to merge and revive them as modern CakePHP 5.x plugin.
Hopefully we can have all the features back up and working soon.

### Install, Setup, Usage
See the **[Docs](docs/README.md)** for details.
